# pybhspc: Control Becker-Hickl SPC devices in Python

(Introduction coming.)

## Requirements

Windows 10+ (64-bit Intel) only.

Python 3.10+ (64-bit).

The Becker-Hickl SPCM DLL (part of their "TCSPC Package" installer) must be
installed on the system. The most recent version is usually recommended;
absolute minimum is version 4.0 (Apr 2014; but versions below 5.2 have not been
tested). Note that these are version numbers of the SPCM DLL, not of the TCSPC
Package or the SPCM application.
